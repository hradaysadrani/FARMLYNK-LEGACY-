# FARMLYNK_LEGACY
 This repository contains code and circuit diagram (made using fritzing) of my project FARMLYNK.

 ## What is Farmlynk?

 Farmlynk is an device which automates irrigation system of a field. It also allows to remotely control irrigation with the help of an customized IoT mobile application "Blynk".
 

NOTE - This project was done when I was in class 10th (i.e., in October 2019) and was designed when the legacy version of Blynk was in use. The code may require changes to enable this program to run on the next-generation Blynk IoT platform, as the legacy version servers have now been permanently disabled. 

A new, better, and updated version of FARMLYNK with useful features will soon be published on my GitHub profile!!
