# FARMLYNK_LEGACY
 This repository contains code and circuit diagram (made using fritzing) of my project FARMLYNK.

NOTE - This project was done when I was in class 10th (i.e., in October 2019) and was designed when the legacy version of Blynk was in use. The code may require changes to enable this program to run on the next-generation Blynk IoT platform, as the legacy version servers have now been permanently disabled.
